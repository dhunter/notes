	- CSS elements with multiple measurements on one line
		- The numbers start on the top and go clockwise around the item	
		- {border: 0px 10px 20px 30px;} would have a:
			- 0px border on top
				- (0 doesn't require a measurement type, but can still use)
			- 10px border on the right side
			- 20px border on the bottom
			- 30px border on the left side
		- Shorthand options
			- {border: 0px 10px 20px;}
				- 0px on top
				- 10px on left and right
				- 20px on bottom
			- {border: 0px 10px;}
				- 0px border on top and bottom
				- 10px border on left and right
			- {border: 0px;}
				- 0px border on all four sides
	- Displaying Elements
		- display: block --> nothing else on the same line, but can set width/height
		- display: inline --> anything can appear on same line, but can't set width/height
		- display: inline-block --> combination of prior two
			- Can appear on same line and also can set width/height
		- Hiding Elements
			- (for quizzes, etc)
			- display: none --> removes both the element and its position in the document
				- As if you just deleted the element entirely in the page source
			- visibility: hidden --> removes the element, but keeps its position
				- i.e. you'll see a hole where the element should have been displayed
	- Positioning
		- float: [left/right/etc]
			- Text that was below will now surround the targeted tag
		- position: static - (default) - positioned according to the normal flow of document
		- position: relative
			- Setting top, right, bottom or left properties will move the item relative to its normal, (position: static) position
		- position: fixed
			- Holds position relative to viewport
			- Does not move with scrolling
			- (Can use for menu bar, etc)
		- position: absolute
			- Setting top, right, bottom or left properties will move the item relative to its parent element's position, (including <body>, if no other parents)
			- Moves with scrolling.
		- position: sticky
			- position: relative until it's original position is reached in the document, then swaps to position: fixed
			- (A somewhat more elegant menu bar, etc, if {top: 0;})
		- z-index
			- Only works on items where all items in question have position <> static
				- (Items to go behind need position: absolute/fixed/sticky)
			- Determines 3D display order, (default: 0)
			- Lower values appear behind higher ones
				- If z-indexes are equal, items coming first in the html code will be displayed behind items that come after
					- i.e. if you have 3 divs with equal z-indexes, listed one after another in an html file:
						- Div 1 will be displayed at the back
						- Div 2 will be displayed in the middle
						- Div 3 will be displayed in the front
	- Fonts
		- Embedding
			- In header:
				- <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?=family[name of family1]|[name of family2]|[name of family3]" rel="stylesheet">
		- Sizing
			- 16px, (fixed size) = 100%, (scaling) = 1em, (scaling) = 1rem, (scaling)
				- To convert fixed font size to scaling, divide by 16 = Xem/Xrem
			- Note: scaling inherits from all parent elements
				- So, if <body> is 2em and <h1> is 3em, final size = 6em
				- Unless you use "rem," which ignores all parent settings
					- So, in above, if <h1> is 3rem, (instead of 3em), final size = 3em
	- Designer vs Non-Designer Thinking
		- https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/12399734#content
		- Color Theory
			- Different shades have different "moods"
				- i.e. Elicit different reactions in people seeing them
					- Many of those reactions are common
				- Good exercise is to analyze (especially print) ads to see how they use color to evoke desired reactions
			- Red
				- Love, Energy, Intensity
				- Generates excitement
			- Yellow
				- Joy, Intellect, Attention
				- Too much yellow can generate attention fatigue
			- Green
				- Freshness, Safety, Growth
				- (Often used for food ads)
			- Blue
				- Stability, Trust, Serenity
				- (medical/medicine/health)
			- Purple
				- Royalty, Wealth, Femininity
			- Combining Colors to make Color Palettes
				- Analogous Colors, (2 colors)
					- Selecting adjacent colors on the color wheel
					- Harmonious, Easy to look at for long periods.
					- Good for primary interface
				- Complimentary Colors, (2 colors)
					- Selecting diametrically-opposed colors on the color wheel
					- Attention-grabbing, but hard to look at for long periods.
					- Bad choice for primary interface.
				- Split Colors, (3 colors)
					- Way of toning down disharmony of Complimentary
					- Instead of picking complimentary color, instead the pick two colors surrounding the complimentary color.
					- Still attention-grabbing, but not as clashy
				- Triadic Colors, (3 colors)
					- Selecting 3 colors equidistant around color wheel
				- Monochromatic, (2 colors)
					- Adding darker or lighter second color in the same family
		- Typography
			- 2 different fonts are good, 3 is pushing it, 4+ is bad
			- Keep moods and time eras consistent
				- i.e. Don't mix Roaring 20's-ish font with Renaissance-ish font
			- Contrast serif-ness, (serif vs sans-serif) and font weights
		- UI Design
			- Function comes before form in all cases
			- Ingrained visual impulses
				- Eyes automatically go to biggest, boldest, brightest thing first
				- Then round things
				- Then smaller things
				- Then lighter-shaded things
			- Think of application as a journey
				- Title > Sub-title > Larger images > Smaller images > Some text
			- Minimize number of alignment lines, (horizontal & vertical)
				- More alignment lines are perceived as "messy"
			- Should work to provide conscious and subconscious queues
				- Use 3D lighting effects to make elements seem more like real world
					- Light should always come from above			
					- i.e. To improve clickthrough on clickable button
						- Unpressed state - slight shadow on bottom
						- Pressed state - no shadow
			- Start in monochrome
				- Focus on spacing / positioning, etc
				- To avoid getting distracted by colors
				- Then add a single pop of color
					- And build up color from there
			- Make sure text over images stands out / is easily readable
				- Especially where image will change
					- If image will always be static, can just mod text color
					- Make sure and test in front of a whole slew of images
				- Colored overlay above image
					- Can look a bit ugly
						- Reducing opacity can help
							- Gaussian blur has similar effect
	- Responsive Design
		- Page design changes based on viewport / screen size used, (i.e. laptop vs ipad vs phone)
			- Bootstrap, (https://getbootstrap.com/)
				- There are other front-end frameworks that perform similar tasks
					- (Bootstrap provides additional CSS functionality beyond just responsive design)
				- Navbar, (requires Javascript)
					- Navbar expands / contracts into hamburger menu
				- Grid System
					- Horizontal content broken into 12ths
						- i.e. to display 4 items per line for laptops, 3 per line for ipads and 2 per line for phones
							- Define outer div set to class="row"
								- Actual content class="[below code]"
									- col-xl-3 - 4 items per line, (12/3) for full screen desktops, (xl)
									- col-lg-4 - 3 items per line, (12/4) for full screen laptops, (lg) presuming resolution is less than desktops
									- col-md-6 - 2 items per line, (12/6) for ipads / windowed content, (md) on desktops/laptops
									- col-sm-12 - 1 item per line, (12/12) for phones, (sm)
									- Note: content class has to include space-separated codes for all scenarios desired
										- i.e. to be fully responsive, class="col-xl-3 col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm12"
											- If fewer scenarios specified, will only change display where specified
												- i.e. if only use "col-md-6" by itself, every viewport from medium up in size, (md, lg, xl) will show 2 per line, and below medium, (sm) will show 1 per line.
			- Media Queries
				- Choose different css selectors based on:
					- Media types, (print, screen, speech) and/or
					- Media features, (height, width, orientation, resolution)
				- Encase css selectors within query specifying situation they should apply to
					- i.e. @media screen (min-width: 900px) { [css selectors] }
				- Should start from mobile / smallest screen first
				- If you model css selector classes identically - i.e.:
					- @media screen (min-width: 600px) {
  					- /* For tablets: */
					- .col-s-1 {width: 8.33%;}
					- .col-s-2 {width: 16.66%;}
					- .col-s-3 {width: 25%;}
					- ...
					- .col-s-12 {width: 100%;}
					- }
					- 
					- @media screen (min-width: 768px) {
					- /* For desktop: */
					- .col-1 {width: 8.33%;}
					- .col-2 {width: 16.66%;}
					- .col-3 {width: 25%;}
					- ...
					- .col-12 {width: 100%;}
					- }
					-
					- You can then call them exactly as with Bootstrap in html - i.e.:
						- <div class="row">
							<div class="col-3 col-s-3">...</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-s-9">...</div>
							<div class="col-3 col-s-12">...</div>
						- </div>
				- Note: css selectors inside media queries override css selectors outside - i.e.:
					- h1 {color: red;}
					- @media screen (min-width: 900) {h1 {color: blue;}}
					- If width < 900, h1's will be red.
					- If width >= 900, h1's will be blue.

					
	- Accessibility
		- aria-hidden="true"
			- Hides content from assistive technology, (i.e. screen reader) for this and all children elements
				- (for use with buttons, etc)
